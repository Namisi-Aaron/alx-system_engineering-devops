A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It's a powerful tool used in computer science, programming, and text processing to match patterns in strings of text.

Regular expressions consist of literal characters (like letters, digits, etc.) and metacharacters, which have special meaning within the regex syntax. Metacharacters include symbols like ^, $, ., *, +, ?, \, |, [, ], {, }, (, and ), among others.

Here's a brief overview of what some of these metacharacters do:

^ matches the start of a string.
$ matches the end of a string.
. matches any single character except newline characters.
* matches the preceding element zero or more times.
+ matches the preceding element one or more times.
? matches the preceding element zero or one time.
\ is used to escape metacharacters or to introduce special character classes like \d (matches digits), \s (matches whitespace characters), \w (matches word characters), etc.
| represents alternation, allowing for a choice between multiple expressions.
[ and ] define a character class, allowing you to specify a set of characters to match.
{} specifies the number of repetitions of the preceding element
